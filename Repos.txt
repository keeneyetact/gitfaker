Let's discuss in more detail.

We need full-stack developer to develop a two-sided form using React and Node.js (one side where a user inputs data and another side where the data is presented in real-time) called "The Olympics". We expect this work to take about 10 days or less for both the front and back-end work.

Th full requirements are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9qdyeJt3cRHzi61eSyYbBz3WftbE5-zZUUNLzmzGdw/edit?usp=sharing

The UI design is here: https://www.figma.com/file/F3tHxr0PoGLuNuwwyarnaU/The-Olympics---Runaway-Games?type=design&node-id=0-1


We are looking for someone who can demonstrate their ability to write clean code, work collaboratively with a team, and most importantly - someone who writes us personalized answers to our screening questions (not just copy/paste templates!).

We will expect to have 1-2 Google Meets with you to outline the requirements and discuss the nuances so English skills are a MUST!
